Identity Management API Documentation

The Identity Management API is a simple Go application that allows you to manage and retrieve information about identities. This documentation provides an overview of the code structure, endpoints, and how to use the API.
Getting Started

To use the Identity Management API, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have Go (Golang) installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/.

    Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

    Open the Go script (identity_management_api.go) in a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

    Install the required Go package:

go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin

Execute the script using the following command:

bash

    go run identity_management_api.go

    The API will start running on http://localhost:8080.

Endpoints

The Identity Management API provides the following endpoints:
1. Get All Identities

    Endpoint: /identities
    HTTP Method: GET
    Description: Retrieves a list of all identities.
    Response Format: JSON

2. Get Identity by ID

    Endpoint: /identities/:id
    HTTP Method: GET
    Description: Retrieves an identity by its ID.
    Parameters:
        id (Path Parameter): The ID of the identity to retrieve.
    Response Format: JSON

3. Create Identity

    Endpoint: /identities
    HTTP Method: POST
    Description: Creates a new identity and adds it to the list.
    Request Body Format: JSON
    Response Format: JSON

4. Update Identity

    Endpoint: /return
    HTTP Method: PATCH
    Description: Updates an identity's information.
    Query Parameters:
        id (Query Parameter): The ID of the identity to update.
    Response Format: JSON

Code Structure

The Identity Management API script (identity_management_api.go) consists of the following components:

    identity Struct

type identity struct {
    ID     string `json:"id"`
    Name   string `json:"name"`
    Age    int    `json:"age"`
    Gender string `json:"gender"`
}

The identity struct defines the structure of an identity.

identities Variable

    var identities = []identity{ ... }

    The identities variable contains a list of predefined identities.

    Endpoint Functions
        getIdentity: Retrieves a list of all identities.
        returnIdentity: Updates an identity's information.
        identityByID: Retrieves an identity by its ID.
        createIdentity: Creates a new identity and adds it to the list.
        getIdentityByID: Helper function to retrieve an identity by ID.

    main Function

    The main function sets up the API routes, initializes the Gin router, and starts the API on localhost:8080.

Usage

    Start the API by running the script using go run identity_management_api.go.

    Use an API client (e.g., curl, Postman, or your browser) to interact with the API endpoints.

    You can use the following endpoints to manage identities:
        To get a list of all identities, make a GET request to /identities.
        To get an identity by ID, make a GET request to /identities/:id.
        To create a new identity, make a POST request to /identities with a JSON body containing the identity details.
        To update an identity, make a PATCH request to /return with a query parameter id specifying the ID of the identity to update.

Conclusion

The Identity Management API allows you to manage and retrieve information about identities. By following the instructions in this documentation, you can set up and use the API to perform various operations, such as retrieving identity details, creating new identities, and updating existing identities. This API can be useful for building identity management systems or sample applications that require identity management functionality.
